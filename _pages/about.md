I am a undergraduate student in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Chung-Ang University, working as a member of the [CVLab](https://cvlab.kaist.ac.kr/home), advised by Professor Minsu Cho. My research lies in the areas of computer vision and deep learning, especially in the 3D computer vision and visual correspondence. If you are interested in my research projects, feel free to contact me via email or visit my Github and LinkedIn.
